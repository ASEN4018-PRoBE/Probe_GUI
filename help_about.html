<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This software is part of the project for CU Aerospace Department Senior Projects 2022-2023. It is intended to be used with the custom designed ProBE box to provide automated testing for the EnerSys 8S16P battery. Additional modification will be needed to support other battery types.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Test configurations are desired to be modified only within this software. If additional configs are required, please follow the format in <i>./test_template/test_template.json</i> in deatil. <u>Do not modify the ordering of test functions.</u></p>

<h2>Test Run</h2>
<p>Test is split into two portions: it first runs with a Digital Multimeter (DMM) and the second runs with Isolation Tester (ISO). A dialog will pop up when DMM portion is completed notifying a switch of banana plugs from DMM to ISO.</p>
<p>View test results and a time history of measurements during or after a test in the "Test Results" page and "Detailed Plots" page.</p>
